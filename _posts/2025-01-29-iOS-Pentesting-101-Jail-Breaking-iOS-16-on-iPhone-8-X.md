# iOS-Pentesting-101: Jail Breaking iOS 16.7.x+ on iPhone 8/X
Hello friend! I am Suraj Sharma, aka sudosuraj. This is an iOS pen-testing series. In this article, we'll cover setting up an iOS pen-testing lab by jailbreaking an iPhone 8 or iPhone X running iOS 16.7.11+. Let's dive in.

## Pre-requisites:
iPhone 8/iPhone X ofc.
PC, and a pen drive.

## Step 1: Install Fresh Firmware (Optional)
Download and install 3U tools in the pc from https://www.3u.com/, connect the iDevice to pc using USB cable. Open the 3U tools and you'll see your phone information there.
In the Smart Flash tab, download the same firmware version for the iDevice version. Once downloaded, install it. This will install fresh firmware on the iDevice so you won't encounter any previous jailbreak errors. Once you have fresh firmware installed in the iDevice, you are good to go.

## Step 2: Palera1n
Download the palera1n iso from https://palera.in/download/?tab=windows, and flash it into your pen drive using Rufus or Balena Etcher. Once done, boot your pc using the flash pen drive.
On the screen, we could see several options. Before processing further, keep in mind that we need to perform this process in two stages.

### Stage 1: In the first stage, we'll use Rootful jailbreak with the create fakeFS option enabled.
Select the create fakeFS option and boot

### Stage 2: and in the second stage, we'll use Rootful jailbreak without create fakeFS.

Once you are done, you'll have installed Palera1n on your iDevice. Open Palera1n, install Sileo, and create a new password if it prompts you to enter one. Now, you are good to go with iOS App pen-testing.
You can also install Cydia, and AppSync. To do this, follow these steps:
Download Cydia and AppSync from my Github: https://github.com/sudosuraj/ios-pentesting-101
Transfer .deb files to your iDevice using 3u Tools.
In iDevice, use Filza file manager to click on the .deb file and open it with Selio. Then, click' Get' to install the .deb file.

I'll recommend you the https://github.com/sudosuraj/ios-pentesting-101 repo for my future updates.
